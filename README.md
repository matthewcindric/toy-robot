# TOY ROBOT
I spent another hour on this and made it better(?)
Or at least different.

## TO-DO
### (NOT exhaustive)
1. Yeet functions from Mr Roboto
2. Build an interface
3. Check for valid constraints when placing
4. Make placement generally less redundant
5. Make turning also less redundant
6. Give the Table class a reason to live
7. Delete the block of old code that reminds me of dark times
8. Try not to cry
